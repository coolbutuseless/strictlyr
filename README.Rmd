The goal of `strictlyr` is to provide functions that are stricter about violations
of some common assumptions during data manipulation.

The key issues which this package will initially focus on handling:

* datasets in the environment should not have groups
* conditions and predicates (for example in `filter()` and `if_else()`) should never
  evaluate to an `NA` value.
* in a `case_when()` the "looseness" of the matching can mean that it is easy to make mistakes
* there is a need for a more specialised `left_join()` which enforces some conditions on the RHS



To address these issues, `strictlyr` will:

1. include drop-in replacement functions which check for issues internally and raise 
   errors, warnings or messages.
2. include alternate versions of dplyr functions which enforce particular assumptions



## Installation + Usage

You can install `strictlyr` from [github](https://github.com/coolbutuseless/strictlyr) with:

``` r
remotes::install_github("coolbutuseless/strictlyr")
```


```{r eval=TRUE}
# Always load `dplyr` first
library(dplyr    , warn.conflicts = FALSE)
library(strictlyr, warn.conflicts = FALSE)
```


## Assumption: data in the environment should not have groups.

In 100% of the code that I write, I do not want data.frames with groups in the global environment. 

Every `group_by()` I write is paired with an immediate `ungroup()` after I've 
done what needs doing.  If I ever forget to `ungroup()` then this is a mistake that
will lead to data issues later in the script.

`strictlyr` includes a drop-in replacement for the pipe operator which checks
if the input or output data is grouped.


```{r error=TRUE}
res1 <- mtcars %>%
  group_by(cyl) %>%
  mutate(mpg = max(mpg))
```


This error may be configured by setting either of the following options:

* setting `options(STRICTLYR_LOG = 'quiet')` - make all `strictlyr` functions quiet
* setting `options(STRICTLYR_PIPE = 'quiet')` - make only the pipe quiet

Possible values for `STRICTLYR_PIPE` are **"stop"**, **"warning"**, **"message"**, and **"quiet"**.


```{r}
options(STRICTLYR_PIPE = 'quiet') # Suppress `strictlyr` output for the pipe

res1 <- mtcars %>%
  group_by(cyl) %>%
  mutate(mpg = max(mpg))
```



## Assumption: Predicates in a `filter()` operation should never produce `NA`s

An `NA` as a result of a predicate in a `filter()` statement is almost always an 
indication that I have made a mistake e.g. I don't understand my data, I've
made an earlier data handling error, or new data has violated earlier assumptions.

To be clear: having `NA` values in the actual dataset is fine, but having `NA` as the result
of a filter predicate is not.

An example of a type of error that can occur if a wild and unexpected `NA` appears
in your dataset is included below.  In this scenario, `df$x` previously never
contained `NA` values, but a data update violated this assumption.   Code that 
previously worked now silently drops any row where `x == NA`!


```{r}
# Dataset with 3 rows
test_df <- data.frame(x = c(1, NA, 3), y = c(4, 5, 6))

# split the data
low_df  <- test_df %>% filter(x <  2)
high_df <- test_df %>% filter(x >= 2)

# calculate something on the separate datasets and then re-combine.
# Now there are only 2 rows in the data!
dplyr::bind_rows(low_df, high_df)
```





## Assumption: The condition in an `if_else()` statement should never produce `NA`s

An `NA` as a result of the condition in an `if_else` statement is almost always an 
indication that I have made a mistake e.g. I don't understand my data, I've
made an earlier data handling error, or new data has violated earlier assumptions.


An example of a type of error that can occur if a wild and unexpected `NA` appears
in your dataset is included below.  In this scenario, `x` previously never
contained `NA` values, but a data update violated this assumption.   Code that 
previously worked now changes the total count of 


```{r}
# A rogue 'NA' has appeared in the data where there never was before.
x <- c(1, 2, NA)

size <- if_else(x < 2, 'small', 'large')

N_small <- length(size[size == 'small'])
N_large <- length(size[size == 'large'])

# Now have a erroneous count
N_small + N_large
```





## Assumption: For `case_when()`, each input element should match only 1 rule.

In the following `case_when()` code the output is a pretty awful due to a combination
of typos, rule misspecification, and `NA` values.

I want a `case_when()` which avoids some easy errors i.e. it should:

* tell me that there are multiple rules which match when the input is 'dog'
* disallow the bare `TRUE` rule so that `catt` would be picked up as a typo rather than classified as a reptile.
* somehow stop the `NA` value being classed as a reptile.  An easy solution would again be to disallow the
  bare `TRUE` rule.

```{r}
animal <- c('cat', 'dog', 'dogs', 'snake', NA)

case_when(
  animal == 'catt'          ~ 'mammal',
  animal == 'dog'           ~ 'mammal', 
  startsWith(animal, 'dog') ~ "best friend",
  TRUE                      ~ "reptile"
)
```


`case_when()` applies the first matching rule that it finds, and this is often
very useful.  So to the match the desired strict behaviour, there would need to be alternate function called
`strict_case_when()`. See this post for more discussion: https://coolbutuseless.github.io/2018/09/06/strict-case_when/


## Assumption: In a `left_join()` operation, the RHS should have (at most) one row matching each row in the LHS

In the majority of `left_join()` calls, I expect (at most) one match in the
RHS dataset.   In these types of `left_join()` calls, wheee there are multiple 
matching rows in the RHS, I would prefer an error rather than the propagation of
duplicate rows.

```{r}
# Expecting one measurement of weight and height per subject
# There is an erroneous duplicate height recorded for subject 2
weight <- data.frame(ID = 1:2, wt = c(10, 20))
height <- data.frame(ID = c(1, 2, 2, 3), ht = c(20, 21, 21, 22))

# Now the total measurements data has a duplicate row too!
measurements <- weight %>% left_join(height, by = 'ID')
measurements
```


The `left_join` is quite a powerful operator, and restricting the RHS to one matching
row would cripple its usefulness in general.  So I think there should be alternate function: `strict_left_join()`

See other discussion about `left_joins()` and multiple matching rows in:

* https://github.com/tidyverse/dplyr/issues/2278
* https://github.com/tidyverse/dplyr/issues/1619
* - add post-join diagnostics to the output.

## Guidelines for function design within `strictlyr`

Drop-in replacement functions should

* by default, raise an error when assumptions are violated.
* use `options()` to configure output behaviour when assumptions are violated. i.e. 
  'error', 'warn', 'message' or 'quiet'
* if the output is set to 'quiet', then the behaviour of the drop-in replacement should
  be indistinguishable from the original function.
* output behaviour should be configurable both globally and per-function.


New/alternate functions should

* output behaviour is not governed by setting `options()`
* have a `strict_` prefix. e.g. `strict_filter()` would be an alternative to `filter()`
